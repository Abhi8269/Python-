            or society to cope using its own resources.</p></tr>

    <h2>LET'S WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS DISASTER+MANAGEMENT</h2>
    <div class="pp">Disaster management is how we deal with the human, material, economic or environmental impacts of said disaster, it is the process of how we “prepare for, respond to and learn from the effects of major failures”.
        Though often caused by nature, disasters can have human origins.</div>
    <h2>TYPES OF DISASTER</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="b">Natural</li>
        <div class="pp">A natural disaster is the highly harmful impact on a society or community 
            following a natural hazard event. Some examples of natural hazard events include: flooding
            , drought, earthquake, tropical cyclone, lightning, 
            tsunami, volcanic activity, wildfire.</div>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Natural Disaster</h3>
    <ul>
         <li class="b">EARTHQUAKE</li>
            An earthquake is the sudden release of strain energy in the Earth's crust, 
                resulting in waves of shaking that radiate outwards from the earthquake source. When stresses
                 in 
                the crust exceed the strength of the rock, 
                it breaks along lines of weakness, either a pre-existing or new fault plane</li>
                <img src="ear.jpg" alt="gh" class="AS">
            <li class="b">TROPICAL CYCLONE</li>
            <div>
                tropical cyclone is a rapid rotating storm originating over tropical 
                oceans from where it draws the energy to develop. It has a low pressure centre and clouds 
                spiraling 
                towards the eyewall surrounding the "eye", 
                the central part of the system where the weather is normally calm and free of clouds.
                <img src="ear2.jpg" alt="df" class="AS"></div>
            <li class="b">VOLCANIC ACTIVITY</li>
            <div>activity ranges from emission of gases, 
                non-explosive lava emissions to extremely violent explosive bursts that may
                 last many hours. The types of eruptions determine the relative volumes and types of 
                 volcaniclastic material and lava flows, consequently the shapes and sizes of volcanoes.

            <li>On December 26, 2004, an earthquake off the coast of Sumatra caused the Indian Ocean Tsunami. 
                The Indian plate subducting beneath the Burmese plate is what caused it to happen. Over 2.4 lakh 
                people were 
                killed in the Indian Ocean region and its neighbouring countries.</li>

        <li class="b">MAN MADE DISASTER</li>
           Disasters disasters are events which are caused by man, either 
            intentionally or by accident, which that can directly or indirectly cause severe threats, 
            either directly or indirectly, to public health and/or well-being. Because their occurrence is 
            unpredictable, man-made disasters pose an especially challenging threat which that must be dealt 
            with through vigilance, and proper preparedness and response. Information on the major sources of 
            man-made disasters have beenare provided here to help
             educate the public on their cause and effects as they relate to emergency planning
    <h3>Types of man disaster</h3>
             <ul>
                <li class="b">Civil Disorder</li>
                    Civil disorder, also known as civil disturbance, civil unrest, or social unrest, is a situation arising from
                     a mass act of civil disobedience (such as a demonstration, riot, strike, or unlawful assembly) 
                    in which law enforcement has difficulty maintaining their authority.</li>

                <li class="b">BIOLOGICAL/CHEMICAL DISASTER</li>
                    Chemical and biological weapons are organisms, toxins, and chemicals used to cause death
                     or harm through their poisonous properties. Alongside nuclear weapons, biological 
                     and chemical weapons are weapons of mass destruction because they can kill 
                    or injure large numbers of people and cause environmental damage.</li>

                    <li><span class="rty">First example of biological/chemical disaster=</span>The Bhopal disaster or Bhopal gas
                         tragedy was a chemical accident on the night of 2–3 December 1984 at the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide p
                         lant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. Considered the world's worst industrial disaster,[1] over 500,000 people in the sma
                         ll towns around the plant were exposed to the highly toxic gas methyl isocyanate (MIC).[2] Estimates vary on the death tol
                         l, with the official number of immediate deaths being 2,259. In 2008, the Government of Madhya Pradesh paid compensation to 
                         the family members of 3,787 victims killed in the gas release, and to 574,366 injured victims.[3] A government affidavit in
                          2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and 
                         approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling 
                         injuries.[4] Others estimate that 
                         8,000 died within two weeks, and another 8,000 or more have
                         since died from gas-related diseases.[5]</li>
